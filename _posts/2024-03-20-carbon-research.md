Our recent research into carbon-climate feedback mechanisms reveals important insights about future carbon sequestration capacity. As we work toward carbon neutrality by 2050, understanding how land and ocean systems will respond to changing climate conditions becomes increasingly critical.

## Key Findings

Current data shows that land and ocean systems absorb approximately 50% of global carbon emissions. However, our models suggest that this absorption capacity may change significantly under future climate scenarios.

Our integrated Earth system models help us understand:
- How warming temperatures affect soil carbon storage
- Ocean acidification impacts on marine carbon uptake
- Vegetation responses to changing precipitation patterns
- Feedback loops between carbon storage and climate change

This research contributes to more accurate climate projections and informs policy decisions for achieving global climate goals.
