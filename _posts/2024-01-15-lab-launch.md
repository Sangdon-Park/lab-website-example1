We are excited to announce the launch of the KAIST Climate System Lab! Our interdisciplinary research group focuses on understanding the complex interactions within Earth's climate system through advanced modeling and data analysis.

Our lab addresses one of the greatest challenges facing humanity - climate change. We combine expertise in climate science, Earth system modeling, and environmental analysis to develop innovative solutions for climate adaptation and mitigation.

## Research Focus

Our research spans four main areas:

- **Climate System Science**: Exploring interactions between Earth's atmosphere, land, and ocean systems
- **Earth System Modeling**: Developing integrated models to predict future climate states
- **Carbon-Climate Feedback**: Understanding how climate change impacts global carbon cycles
- **Fire-Climate Interactions**: Analyzing fire dynamics under changing atmospheric conditions

## Join Our Team

We welcome passionate researchers at all levels - undergraduate interns, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. If you're interested in contributing to cutting-edge climate research, please contact Prof. Jin-Soo Kim at jinddu@gmail.com.
